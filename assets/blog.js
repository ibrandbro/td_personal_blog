    /* ── INTRODUCTION ── */
    '<p>Financial crime management is no longer a policy or compliance exercise — it has become a real-time, system-driven challenge. Regulators increasingly expect organisations to prove that controls are not only defined, but actively working within operational systems. This means demonstrating how decisions are made, how alerts are generated, and how risks are identified and acted upon with full auditability.</p>',

    '<p>At the same time, financial crime itself has evolved significantly. Criminal networks are more sophisticated, leveraging digital channels, automation, and emerging technologies to scale fraud. Traditional rule-based approaches are struggling to keep up with dynamic patterns such as synthetic identities, coordinated scams, and cross-border fund movements.</p>',

    '<p>The shift toward real-time payments and digital onboarding has further increased pressure on organisations. Risk decisions that were once made over days must now be executed in seconds. This requires continuous monitoring, faster decision engines, and integrated data across the entire customer lifecycle.</p>',

    '<p>Internally, most institutions face fragmentation and ownership challenges. Key functions — KYC, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and case management — often operate across disconnected systems. Responsibilities are split across Compliance, Risk, Fraud Operations, Data Engineering, and Technology, without clearly defined accountability. These gaps lead to inconsistent execution and are a common root cause in regulatory findings.</p>',

    '<div class="shift-block"><div class="shift-block-label">The industry shift</div><div class="shift-row"><div class="shift-old">&ldquo;Do we have controls?&rdquo;</div><div class="shift-arrow">&#8594;</div><div class="shift-new">&ldquo;Do our systems actually enforce those controls effectively?&rdquo;</div></div></div>',

    '<p>Organisations are responding by moving toward integrated, technology-driven frameworks — leveraging APIs, event-driven architectures, and data platforms that support both real-time and batch processing. AI is also being introduced to enhance detection and operational efficiency, but must be implemented with strong governance, explainability, and human oversight.</p>',

    '<p>Ultimately, organisations that treat financial crime as a connected system design problem — linking data, workflows, ownership, and architecture — will be better positioned to manage risk, meet regulatory expectations, and scale operations effectively.</p>',

    '</div>',

    '<h2>Framework Implementation: From Regulation to Execution</h2>',

    '<p>A financial crime framework must go beyond documentation and define a structured flow across onboarding, identity verification, due diligence, screening, monitoring, and escalation — all connected as part of a single operating model. Each step must clearly define what data is required, which system provides it, what validation is performed, and who owns the process. This ensures every control is traceable, auditable, and connected to upstream and downstream processes.</p>',

    '<p>In practice, many institutions fail not because they lack policies, but because execution is fragmented. KYC may live in one system, sanctions in another, and transaction monitoring in a completely separate platform. This creates blind spots where risk signals are not connected, ownership is unclear, and controls are inconsistently applied. A customer may pass onboarding checks but later trigger suspicious behaviour in transactions — and if systems are not integrated, the monitoring platform may not have full visibility into the original risk profile.</p>',

    '<p>Architecturally, it requires a mix of real-time APIs for decisioning and batch systems for historical analysis, supported by event-driven pipelines that allow data to flow across systems without delay. The result is a connected framework rather than a collection of disconnected controls.</p>',

    '<h2>AML Architecture: Real-Time vs Batch</h2>',

    '<p>Modern AML systems require a hybrid architecture that balances real-time responsiveness with large-scale data processing. Real-time components are critical for onboarding decisions, sanctions screening, and high-risk transaction blocking. Batch processing plays a key role in historical analysis, feature generation, model training, and large-scale transaction monitoring where performance and data volume are primary concerns.</p>',

    '<p>Many organisations either over-invest in real-time systems or rely too heavily on batch processing. Real-time-only systems often lack historical context, leading to poor decision quality, while batch-heavy systems introduce delays in detecting high-risk activity. A suspicious transaction may occur in real time but if the system depends on overnight batch scoring, the alert is delayed — and the funds may already be gone.</p>',

    '<div class="diagram"><div class="diagram-title">Architecture pattern</div><div class="flow"><span class="node">Customer / Merchant</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">API Layer</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Real-Time Engine</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Alert / Block</span></div><div class="flow" style="margin-top:10px"><span class="node">Kafka / Events</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Data Lake</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Batch Scoring</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Monitoring Alerts</span></div></div>',

    '<p>A unified architecture connects real-time and batch layers through shared data models and consistent validation logic. APIs handle immediate decision points; event-driven pipelines ensure data is continuously captured and processed for deeper analysis. This allows organisations to act quickly while maintaining analytical depth and full regulatory compliance.</p>',

    '<h2>Who Owns What in Financial Crime Programs?</h2>',

    '<p>One of the most common failure points in financial crime programs is not technology, but unclear ownership. While multiple teams are involved — Compliance, Risk, Fraud Operations, Data Engineering, and Technology — responsibilities are often loosely defined. Without a clear ownership model, even well-designed frameworks can fail: each team may assume another is responsible, resulting in delayed decisions, inconsistent controls, and increased regulatory risk.</p>',

    '<p>In many organisations, Compliance defines policies but lacks visibility into system implementation. Technology builds platforms but may not fully understand regulatory intent. Fraud Operations handles alerts but may not have control over data quality or thresholds. During audits, these gaps become visible as inconsistent decision-making, unclear accountability, and lack of traceability — all of which are red flags for regulators.</p>',

    '<div class="diagram"><div class="diagram-title">Ownership model</div><div class="flow" style="margin-bottom:8px"><span class="node">Compliance</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Policy &amp; Governance</span></div><div class="flow" style="margin-bottom:8px"><span class="node">Risk</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Methodology &amp; Thresholds</span></div><div class="flow" style="margin-bottom:8px"><span class="node">Fraud Ops</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Alert Review &amp; Investigation</span></div><div class="flow" style="margin-bottom:8px"><span class="node">Data Engineering</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Pipelines &amp; Data Quality</span></div><div class="flow"><span class="node">Technology</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Systems &amp; Integration</span></div></div>',

    '<p>A strong model defines ownership at each step of the workflow. Every control must have a clear owner, along with defined responsibilities for data, decisions, and system execution. This requires cross-functional alignment and governance structures that ensure accountability across teams — reducing ambiguity and strengthening the consistency of control execution across the entire financial crime program.</p>',

    '<h2>Where AI Fits in Regulated Workflows</h2>',

    '<p>AI is increasingly being introduced into financial crime and compliance workflows, but its role must be carefully defined within a regulated environment. Rather than replacing decision-making, AI is most effective when used to enhance data processing, pattern detection, and operational efficiency. Document extraction, anomaly detection, and case summarisation can significantly improve productivity — but must be integrated in a way that maintains transparency, auditability, and regulatory compliance.</p>',

    '<p>Many organisations attempt to use AI as a replacement for human decision-making, which creates regulatory and operational risks. Black-box models without explainability can lead to compliance failures, governance concerns, and audit challenges. In regulated settings, AI must support the workflow without undermining accountability. Human-in-the-loop design is not optional — it is a core architectural requirement.</p>',

    '<div class="diagram"><div class="diagram-title">AI integration architecture</div><div class="flow"><span class="node">Input Data</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">AI Model</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Risk Insights</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Human Review</span><span class="arr">&#8594;</span><span class="node">Final Decision</span></div></div>',

    '<div class="two-col"><div class="callout"><div class="callout-head">End goal</div><p>Improve efficiency and accuracy without compromising control. AI should enhance human decision-making — surfacing insights while leaving judgment to qualified reviewers.</p></div><div class="callout"><div class="callout-head">Key principle</div><p>AI&#39;s success in regulated workflows depends on careful integration, explainability, and governance at every step — not the sophistication of the model alone.</p></div></div>',

    '<div class="note"><strong>Implementation note</strong><p>In regulated workflows, AI works best as an accelerator, reviewer aid, and evidence-preparation layer — not as a fully autonomous final decision-maker. Design for human-in-the-loop from day one.</p></div>',

    '<h2>Conclusion</h2>',

    '<p>Financial crime programs succeed when they are designed as connected systems — not as collections of independent controls. Each element covered in this guide, from framework design to architecture, ownership, and AI integration, depends on the others. A well-built framework with no clear ownership will break under execution pressure. A sophisticated architecture with no AI governance will introduce risk rather than reduce it.</p>',

    '<p>The organisations that execute most effectively are those that close the loop between policy intent and system-level execution — defining not just what the controls are, but how data flows through them, who owns each step, and how technology is governed at every layer.</p>',
